Open3DALIGN's ChangeLog
-----------------------

*** July 9, 2013: Open3DALIGN 2.242 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Added a few memset() commands to avoid complaints from valgrind


*** July 2, 2013: Open3DALIGN 2.241 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Fixed a bug which prevented building in the absence of libminizip
    header files


*** June 13, 2013: release of Open3DALIGN 2.24 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - A bug which caused the terminal to be set to ECHOCTL on exit was fixed
    (Linux/Mac OS X only)
  - A bug which caused abrupt program exit when PyMOL was closed while
    Open3DALIGN was still running was fixed
  - Linking against libminizip is now optional


*** January 14, 2013: release of Open3DALIGN 2.23 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - A bug in the "import type=DEPENDENT" keyword which caused an error
    message whenever attempting to import multiple dependent variables
    was fixed


*** December 21, 2012: release of Open3DALIGN 2.22 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Minor bugfixes all over


*** September 5, 2012: release of Open3DALIGN 2.21 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Fixed a bug which affected the Windows version on start when the
    program is installed in a location whose path contains spaces
  - Fixed a bug in the import_dependent() function


*** August 10, 2012: release of Open3DALIGN 2.2 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Added compressed file support (GZIP, ZIP formats)
  - Added the "rototrans" keyword to carry out rotations/translations on
    selected objects
  - Added keyword and parameter shell-like TAB completion in interactive
    mode
  - Open3DALIGN was linked against the updated versions of ATLAS (3.10.0)
    and LAPACK (3.4.1) libraries
  - Under Mac OS X, Open3DALIGN was linked against the ATLAS library instead
    of the Accelerate Framework, since I relized that, as of Mac OS X
    10.7, the LAPACK library included in the Accelerate Framework is not
    completely thread-safe. In previous pre-built Open3DALIGN versions this
    might have triggered numerical errors when using n_cpus > 1


*** February 17, 2012: release of Open3DALIGN 2.105 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - The "box" keyword now supports also "[x,y,z]_nodes" parameters as
    alternative to "[x,y,z]_end"


*** January 12, 2012: release of Open3DALIGN 2.104 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Open3DALIGN was linked with the updated versions of ATLAS (3.8.4) and
    LAPACK (3.4.0) libraries


*** October 22, 2011: release of Open3DALIGN 2.103 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Fixed a bug connected with different CR/LF handling on the Windows
    platform


*** October 15, 2011: release of Open3DALIGN 2.102 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Fixed a bug which prevented restoring the default terminal color on
    exit on *NIX platforms
  - Added the "--term" command line switch to toggle terminal mode; this
    results in default terminal colors to be used for text and, on Windows,
    in preventing a new CMD window from being spawned on start


*** September 19, 2011: release of Open3DALIGN 2.101 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Replaced the dependency from the obsolete termcap library with the one
    from the ubiquitous curses library on Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X and
    FreeBSD platforms


*** September 1, 2011: release of Open3DALIGN 2.1 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - The "filter" keyword was implemented to allow template filtering/
    selection before carrying out multiple template alignment


*** August 30, 2011: release of Open3DALIGN 2.043 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - A regression introduced in version 2.042 which caused the "qmd" command
    to fail with a segmentation fault was fixed


*** August 26, 2011: release of Open3DALIGN 2.042 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - A regression introduced in version 2.0 which caused the "qmd" command
    to fail to discard identical conformations when they are characterized
    by a high degree of symmetry was fixed
  - A bug in the compare() function which caused it to yield slightly
    incorrect RMSD values when using the option type=BLOCK was fixed
  - Minor reorganization of the code tree


*** August 23, 2011: release of Open3DALIGN 2.041 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Temporary files created in the scratch folder by the "align" command
    are removed immediately after use


*** August 20, 2011: release of Open3DALIGN 2.04 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - A bug which caused a crash in the Windows version upon resizing the
    program window on start followed by pressing "arrow up" was fixed
  - A bug which caused duplicate command-line history entries to disappear
    in the Windows version was fixed
  - A bug which might cause the Windows version to crash when using
    multiple CPUs was fixed
  - A regression introduced in version 2.02 which caused the "qmd" command
    to fail under many instances was fixed
  - More robust error handling was implemented


*** August 2, 2011: release of Open3DALIGN 2.03 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - The "remove_y_vars" keyword was added


*** July 26, 2011: release of Open3DALIGN 2.021 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Fixed a bug which caused "align type=MIXED" to fail with an error
    message when dealing with large datasets


*** July 24, 2011: release of Open3DALIGN 2.02 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Implementation of a more robust Y variable import procedure both in the
    "import type=SDF" and in the "import type=DEPENDENT" modules; for this
    purpose, the "y_var_list" parameter was replaced by the "y_var_name"
    parameter
  - Fixed a bug which caused sudden logout from the interactive program
    shell under particular conditions


*** June 29, 2011: release of Open3DALIGN 2.01 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Implementation of a more robust check of OpenBabel/PHARAO functionality
    on program start
  - Fixed a bug connected with the "align" keyword when single-conformation
    PHAR and MIXED types were chosen
  - By default, QMD temporary folders are not deleted anymore after QMD; to
    force their removal the "remove_qmd_folder=YES" parameter must be
    included in the command line


*** June 4, 2011: release of Open3DALIGN 2.0 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Implementation of two additional alignment algorithms (atom-based and
    mixed) in addition to the original, pharmacophore-based one relying on
    Pharao
  - Single and multi-conformational alignment can now be accomplished,
    incorporating flexibility either in alignment candidates only, or in
    templates only, or in both templates and candidates
  - The capability to restart QMD searches and alignment tasks from the
    point from which they had been interrupted was implemented
  - More efficient parallelization was achieved
  - "n_cpus" is not a parameter to parallel-enabled computations anymore;
    instead, a new "O3_N_CPUS" environment variable (as well as a new
    "n_cpus" parameter to the "env" keyword) has been added which is valid
    for all parallel-enabled computations
  - A bug which under certain conditions might cause a segmentation fault
    on start due to buffer overflow was fixed
  - Minor bugfixes all over


*** April 9, 2011: release of Open3DALIGN 1.03 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - More robust error-checking was implemented concerning the availability
    of external software
  - A bug which under certain conditions might cause a segmentation fault
    on start due to buffer overflow was fixed
  - A bug concerning object numbers vs object IDs was fixed
  - Minor bugfixes all over


*** March 7, 2011: release of Open3DALIGN 1.02 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - The "box", "remove_box", "remove_object", "load" and "save" keywords
    have been added


*** February 16, 2011: release of Open3DALIGN 1.01 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - More efficient integration with OpenBabel, which results in faster
    loading and visualization in PyMOL of imported molecules, particularly
    on Windows
  - Fixed some issues in the superpose_conf() routine which might cause
    small numeric discrepancies across different platforms


*** January 31, 2011: release of Open3DALIGN 1.0 ***
